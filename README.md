# CSE360 : Computer Interfacing

This course will give an overview of computer interface components and their characteristics. It will cover detailed discussion on some programmable interfacing ICs, sensor, hardware, and software calibration on sensor interfacing, some processing devices which can interface computers with the real world and some output devices. This course also includes high power interface devices, LED, LCD, Seven segment display, transducers, stepper motors and peripheral devices. In addition, it will also introduce some software simulation tools to develop an interfacing system. Some advanced topics like Human Computer Interface (HCI), Brain Computer Interface (BCI) would be also discussed with some case studies.

## Course Objectives
- Introduction with basic Interfacing, Interfacing Components and their characteristics.
- Outline the working mechanism of different types of sensors, sensing devices, hall-effect sensing, and real life application of some sensors.
- Describe various I/O interfacing including GPIO using MCU/MPU development board and how Programmable Peripheral Interface (PPI) – 82C55 works.
- Explain the working mechanism of Disk, Drum, Motors and Printers and their real life application.
- Describe the types and formats of communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART, USART, and USB.
- Explain LCD, LED, Seven- segment display, Keyboard, Mouse work and interface with their interfacing principal.
